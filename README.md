## üîçProject Details
This project is built using the JavaScript framework, **Vue.js**, which means we're working with a **component-based architecture** that emphasizes **reusability**. At the heart of this website is the core philosophy of using extensive and interconnected components.

We're dealing with components that encompass entire pages, filled with smaller, intercommunicating components managed by **vue-router**. These components interact with a variety of server endpoints through **HTTP requests** designed for making all sorts of **queries to the database** and delivering information in JSON format. The components are equipped with rich methods that process this JSON data and display it in an engaging and visually appealing manner.
